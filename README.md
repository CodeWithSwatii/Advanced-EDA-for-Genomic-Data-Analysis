# Advanced-EDA-for-Genomic-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on exploring genomic data using advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to identify patterns, outliers, and potential genetic variations. It helps researchers and data scientists understand the structure and insights within large-scale biological data.

The system loads a dataset (genomic_data.csv) containing genomic features.

It performs comprehensive EDA using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Key analyses include:

Dataset overview (shape, datatypes, summary statistics)

Missing values detection

Distribution and correlation of numerical features

Categorical feature inspection

Boxplots for outlier detection

Skewness detection

GC Content analysis (a common genomic feature)

Pairplot for multivariate relationships
